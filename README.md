# BellaBeat_CaseStudy

As a theoretical data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, I am tasked with analyzing smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. These insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

The following questions were answered: 
* What are some trends in smart device usage?
* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

The dataset provided was assessed for credibility, cleaned, processed, then analyzed. 
Then, final recommendations were given based on conclusions from the analysis. 

Analysis was done using R Notebook on Kaggle, where the database was from.
